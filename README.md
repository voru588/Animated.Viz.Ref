# Animated.Viz.Python
I have used a COVID-19 data to create interactive and animated visualizations in Python
In this kernel, I intend to look at the spread of the COVID-19 virus with interactive visualization tools of Matplotlib,Seaborn, and Plotly. I tried to use different techniques, styles and formats.
Would be happy to hear your suggestions to correct and/or improve as well as your overall feedback.

Background
What is Covid-19?
Covid-19 is not a coronavirus - it's a viral, contagious, and emerging disease that is transmitted from humans to humans. The severe form of this disease is pneumonia, because the organs infected with the virus are the pulmonary alveoli, where the exchanges take place between the inhaled air and the blood.

What is the origin of SARS-Cov-2?
The virus first appeared in December in a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan , where wild animals were intended for human consumption. According to the most likely thesis, men were contaminated after eating pangolin, a small mammal prized in Asia but also in Africa, itself probably infected with bats.

Can it resist on surfaces?
According to several studies, the virus could last several days or several hours on surfaces such as paper, steel, or plastic. However, "just because a little virus survives doesn't mean it's enough to infect someone who touches that surface. In fact, after a few hours, the vast majority of the virus dies and is probably no longer contagious.

Other scientific work also evokes a capacity of resistance in the air for several hours. However, these results have not been scientifically confirmed and should therefore be taken with caution.

What is its incubation period?
The researchers seem to agree on an average incubation period of six days and a maximum of 14 days. However, there may be some exceptionally longer cases.

What are the symptoms ?
The main symptoms of infection are breathing difficulties, fever above 38 Â° C, chills, intense fatigue, muscle pain and headaches. Loss of taste or smell can also occur in some cases .
